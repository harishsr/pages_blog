I’m Harish and this is the blog where I’ll be clarifying my thoughts as it relates to all things software.

Getting into the CS field has been a tough yet fun experience. I didn’t get a CS degree and instead opted to learn everything I know on my own. Therefore I’ve felt like a fish out of water on numerous occasions but, at times, I’ve also felt like a code ninja that’s delivers.

This is where this blog comes in.

I’ll be relaying my experiences and thoughts here. At times I’ll be a fumbling buffoon. Other times, I’ll actually make sense. In either case, I’ll be sharing what I know and what I’m learning to, both, clarify my thoughts and share what I’m learning.

I’m excited to grow my career, grow this blog, and share what I learn along the way. Stay tuned!
